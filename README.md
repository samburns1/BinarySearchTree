This project creates a the data structure known as Binary tree. The Node class is the heart of the tree. Each node points to a singluar parent node and two child nodes, left child and right child. Nodes hold an integer key which is used for sorting.     
The Binary Tree class creates a sorted tree with nodes. In broad terms, the binary tree can properly insert and delete nodes within the rules of a... binary search tree. The class utilizes several helper methods to simplify larger tasks. For example the insert method would use a helper method to find where a new node needs to be inserted. 
I spent many many hours attempting to create a function binary search tree, but failed. Due to deadlines I had to scrap what I had and follow the guidance from the videos. Probably should have saved what I had, but I did not. I initially thought I succesfully created an insert method, but upon further creating more methods, like delete, and testing, I realized my insert code was flawed in many ways, some which I could not figure out. Using the videos from Mr. Kuszmaul I now have a working binary search tree and fully understand how the tree works and the methods that come with it.
